# Phantom Analyzer
Phantom Analyzer was a tool we [launched](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/phantom-analyzer) during Halloween 2020. It's a much simpler version of [Blacklight by The Markup](https://themarkup.org/blacklight) and we had so much fun running it for a year. We've decided to retire it, and open-source the code to let people either host it themselves, or simply learn how to run Browsershot on Laravel Vapor. This tool is perfect for companies who might want a quick way to audit vendors or companies they're working with.

## Requirements
The following requirements are how we ran Phantom Analyzer.

* PHP 7.4
* [Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com/)
* AWS account

You absolutely can run it outside of Vapor, but we haven't tested that, so it's on you :)

# Instructions

1. Create a new project in Laravel Vapor
2. Put your Vapor Project ID into the vapor.yml file
3. Update the `domain` property in your vapor.yml file (or remove it if desired)
4. Run `vapor deploy production` or `vapor deploy staging`
5. In Vapor, run `pphantom:cache_spy_pixels` to populate DynamoDB (default cache driver) with the spy pixel list
6. Celebrate üçæ

## Updating the spy pixel list
You can add/remove values from the spy pixel list any time you want. We seldom do this, so we hard-coded things, but you can do it.
1. Update `resources/trackers.txt`
2. Open `app/Jobs/ScanWebsite.php` and increase the VERSION constant (e.g. 0.2 becomes 0.3)
3. Deploy to Vapor
4. Run `phantom:cache_spy_pixels` in the Vapor environment to populate the new values

## FAQ
**Question:** What is Laravel Vapor?

**Answer:** If you've never used Laravel Vapor before, but you're curious, take the [Serverless Laravel](https://serverlesslaravelcourse.com/) course and master Laravel Vapor.
